"1","Creepy, way immature, and supremely insecure. This guy gives me the willies, and I'm a 65 year old male. Asking about his own teenage daughter's ""hot"" rating?  Sick, sick, sick.  Additionally, he lies whenever confronted about his wierdo behavior, and never, ever admits to any of his bizarre schnanigans. God help us. ",15,"dogmatic","1"
"2","Bill Clinton is the poster child of a predator sexual abuser whose appetites have disgraced his family and the nation with serial lies and conduct that deservedly led to his numerous encounters will law enforcement, the courts, and his subsequent impeachment all the while Hillary stood by her man like Tammy Wynette supporting his tortured excuses for infidelity and sexual abuse.",15,"dogmatic","2"
"3","It is not modern at all. In no other society was breakfast thought important- even for children.Rather, it is our culture that is aberrant. Why? People make tens of billions of dollars every year from making people fat, keeping them fat, and selling them pills and programs to help them lose weight (which never works long-term).",15,"dogmatic","3"
"4","Hes an ignorant, amoral, dishonest and manipulative, misogynistic, philandering, hyper-litigious, isolationist, protectionist blowhard, Mr. Vlock said. Unfit for the job, an insult not only to McCain but to the nation....without any sense of common decency to knit this country back together. There is NOTHING that justifies voting for him...and I'm a Republican.",15,"dogmatic","4"
"5","Eddie, Hillary's record speaks for itself. You need not go that far to get information on her inability to tell the truth. You can also get a copy of Clinton Cash from the library to see what she, Bill and Chelsea did to raise money for the ""Foundation"". This was the woman that was ""broke"" a short 5 years ago. She is now worth over $200 million. Don't be nieve.",15,"dogmatic","5"
"6","Your chicken little routine flies in the face of reality. Things are not nearly as bad as you claim, and far, far better than they were under Reagan or either Bush. Perhaps things were better under Clinton, but the Clinton era was the best in history.",15,"dogmatic","6"
"7","Only a month or two ago I could chuckle at Trumps antics. No longer. I find him to be a disgusting, ultra-brash hypocrite...and much more. His lying love-fest with the pungent NRA was the last straw. Frankly, I can no longer stomach the sight of this man-child.",15,"dogmatic","7"
"8","The GOP is dead - morally dead, emotionally dead, brain dead, just plain dead. Donald Trump at the top of their ticket proves my point. I always knew they had no heart, now it's obvious they have no soul, just a lust for power and money. Sad, but true.",15,"dogmatic","8"
"9","Mrs. Clinton has leaned heavily on Ellen to help humanize herself beyond policy speeches and personal attacks leveled on cable news.-----------------------------That someone in the public eye for the last 24 years needs help to humanize herself speaks to her complete and utter lack of anything to humanize. Ohh and that trailer was awful.",15,"dogmatic","9"
"10","I hope if Hillary Clinton makes an issue of Trump's ""treatment"" of women, I hope he comes back at her with a furious attack upon her husband's treatment of women, treatment that was physically abusive and in some cases criminal; treatment of women which she overlooked, condoned, and facilitated, all for her political expediency and selfishness.",15,"dogmatic","10"
"11","Mr. Trump, as has been said in many comments, is a scary and dangerous man. I would not vote for him, ever! He has, however, managed to shake up the political establishment on both sides and it was needed, for the political complacency had become something akin to overt contempt for the voter base. He deserves a pat on the back for the shake-up. Though, I agree with Jon Stewart about the man/baby label. ",15,"dogmatic","11"
"12","Yes! Thank goodness both Hillary and Bill Clinton are such honest and honorable people who would never dream of bending the rules, enriching themselves, or abusing young women. Wow! Boy I feel so grateful to have such fine and upstanding candidates on the Democrat side!",15,"dogmatic","12"
"13","So Trump is an Alpha male - BIG deal, so is half of America!!! What's that got to do with him being the President?? What a useless article - being used to attack him in any way possible!! Shame on you NYT!!",15,"dogmatic","13"
"14","Where was the NY Times when Mrs. Clinton played the system and did her single cattle futures deal that netted her 100k? If that wasn't insider trading Then you must have just fallen off the turnip truck. Th liberal media outlets refused to report on it and will not even publish an opinion letter by a reader that calls them out on their  Hypocracy. First amendment? Ha. All the news that's fit, they print.",15,"dogmatic","14"
"15","A root canal is unpleasant, but it's over in a few days. Compare that to 4 years...or 8. ""Mr. Trump"" will remain  ...an ignorant, amoral, dishonest and manipulative, misogynistic, philandering, hyper-litigious, isolationist, protectionist blowhard.""  The man is incapable of becoming any else.",15,"dogmatic","15"
"16","I am mystified how anyone with any ethics, morals or heart could evenconsider voting for this jerk.  That's all he is- an egomaniac, a creep, aspoiled and coddled rich brat. Wake up, America !",15,"dogmatic","16"
"17","Really?If you want to get away with the ultimate insider trading, be a politician. Amazingly, the only female candidate has amassed $100 million as SOS. With a husband who has proven to be a liability. Favors, speeches, etc.ps someone may want to look at Al Gore as well.This wall street stuff is small potatoes.",15,"dogmatic","17"
"18","Why should key Republican donors fund that crooked machiavellian trickster Donald Trump? ?  Trump is a disgusting example of out-of-control Media manipulation to push his hollow candidacy and Trump-brand. There is no journalism remaining in the USA to give intelligent analysis on anything.",15,"dogmatic","18"
"19","Mr. Trump is a master manipulator, preying on the insecurities of others. Some of us can see through his games. Let us hope enough of us can come November. ",15,"dogmatic","19"
"20","Women will have a stark choice in November. They can vote for a pig or they can vote for a woman who has spent her life working on behalf of women. Any woman who votes for Trump should check herself into a mental health facility because she has demonstrated unimaginable self-loathing.",15,"dogmatic","20"
"21","Hes an ignorant, amoral, dishonest and manipulative, misogynistic, philandering, hyper-litigious, isolationist, protectionist blowhard,Mr. Vlock said it.  It's worth repeating, again and again.  ",15,"dogmatic","21"
"22","It's like you guys are TRYING to get Trump elected.  This is very embarrassing.  Trump needs to go. We all know that.  But this article was a pathetic hit piece way beneath the Times standard. You're playing directly into Trump's hands.",15,"dogmatic","22"
"23","The maniacs who support the small-fingered vulgarian will still defend him when he shoots someone on Fifth Avenue, especially if it were a NYTimes reporter. Trump has already foreseen this. He's a prophet who sees a profit in the stupid voter. He knows how to get the stupid vote. He loves the stupid vote. And they love him back.",15,"dogmatic","23"
"24","5 percent unemployment ignores those who unwillingly left the job market. Other statistics show that 47 percent of families can't handle a $400 emergency and over 70 percent live paycheck to paycheck. ""Quiet strength of the economy..."" You've got to be kidding. It's the economy stupid.",15,"dogmatic","24"
"25","If you are a patriotic American, you can not support a lunatic like this.Are you a republican or an American?Trump might actually get us into a nuclear war",15,"dogmatic","25"
"26","Hillary has seven (7) Super Pacs.  She'll get nothing done in her first term, much too busy working through the promises she made in return for the $$$ payola.  Just like her husband, who broke the hearts of the Democrats' beholden  homosexual base in his first term by giving them the cold shoulder, and then DOMA.",15,"dogmatic","26"
"27","The tempest is indicative of society today. It's all about the money in both the Presidential election and the film. No one cares as long as they can work out how to get rich from it. The damage it does to society is completely irrelevant. This little brouhaha is indicative of the way we do business today in the US. The people in charge are greedy charlatans and the rest of us are left holding the bag.",15,"dogmatic","27"
"28","Are you for real ? The guy is taking in $1 billion from puppet master donors, and these frauds are just going to launder their donations to Trump through the DNC. If you think these dudes aren't going to give Trump money in return for favors, you are not paying attention to how this is working. ",15,"dogmatic","28"
"29","Trading in the stock market is, in and by itself a form of gambling. To add to it illegitimate insider trading is, outright theft. It is outrageous and disgusting. No wonder Bernie Sanders is so popular. I am sick and tired of the rich and famous abusing the system. This has got to stop if we don't want the real revolution a la Marie-Antoinette.",15,"dogmatic","29"
"30","I read it. The mask is off. The phony Bernie supporters true colors are shown --- a Trumpeter all along. I've been calling you out as a phony for months and you denied denied denied. Now you reveal yourself as a pro-Trump phony. ""Of course, you won't print this. You won't even read it.""",15,"dogmatic","30"
"31","As opposed to idiot Dems electing a felon awaiting indictment? I would rather see a womanizer who did NOT break the law than a proven liar who thinks she is above the law!",15,"dogmatic","31"
"32","Sorry but just because this woman was flattered Mr Trump wanted to see her in a bikini rather than offended doesn't make the story less true and it certainly doesn't make it less appalling! This man disgusts me.",15,"dogmatic","32"
"33","@kristinab: nobody says there are not poor people, or those having ""hard times"".But if you are poor in the US, you get food stamps. And a child gets the same allotment as an ADULT MAN -- a very generous sum for a small child. You could feed two elementary age children for maybe $50 a week for both of them! and they'd eat very well. Then add in that school gives them FREE breakfast and FREE lunch -- 10 meals out of 21 meals.So there IS NO EXCUSE.",15,"dogmatic","33"
"34","Hahaha!  Are you joking?  Boy, you bought the Clinton propaganda hook, line, and sinker.  When he was unfaithful?  He's been unfaithful their entire marriage.  He's also been accused of sexual assault multiple times.  To stay with him through that makes Hillary and enabler; not someone who's courageous.",15,"dogmatic","34"

"36","please everyone VOTE--- Let's make him a ""Loser"" -- the most painfulending he could experience. Can you imagine?  Trump----Loser!!Doesn't that make you smile?",15,"dogmatic","36"
"37","The liberal media are seething angry that they can not manipulate the voters and control this election the way they have gotten used to.   So now they are determined to wear down Trumps support with numerous daily disparaging ""news"" items, spinning everything possible in a negative way.  Liberal hate is unrelenting!",15,"dogmatic","37"
"38","Contrary to that flawed assumption of this NYT hit piece,   most voters couldn't care less about Trump's personal behavior as a private citizen, especially after a President Bill Clinton.Voters can also make a distinction between Trump's behavior with individual women and the over-generalized smear that Trump treats ALL women the same as these individuals whom the NYT dug up from his past. ",15,"dogmatic","38"
"39","How can anyone seriously discuss this issue of obscenely rich patrons financing candidates without addressing the primary purpose for which the money is given, which is to brainwash the American people further through trite, mendacious and misleading TV ads and media presentations, and to manipulate and buy the politicians in whose names those ads are aired to an all too easily misled electorate.",14,"dogmatic","39"
"40","Ms Brewer has already come out saying her comments were completely twisted and misrepresented. She was quite angry about it and said NYT lied. Obviously this is a hit piece meant to help Hillary. Shameless... this was once a reputable paper right?",14,"dogmatic","40"
"41","Arizona just reduced its allowable time on welfare to ONE year, its 3rd such reduction since 2010.  Can you say, ""border state, and broke.""?  Watch how heavily it votes for The Fence, and the man who will oversee its construction, paid by Mexico.",14,"dogmatic","41"
"42","Thanks goodness that these republican leaders have principles that actually guide their conduct, unlike the elected sort who are proving themselves to be total weasels.",14,"dogmatic","42"
"43","The GOP is still trying to buy elections. Nothing is changed. I know you want Democrats to just lie down and take it, and if they don't you will try to convince the sheep that they are hypocrites. Just because the GOP is bribing the refs, doesn't mean that the Dems can't show up and play the game ...",14,"dogmatic","43"
"44","But I suppose that you approve of rapist Bill Clinton and his enabler wife, right? Trumps makes a few remarks and you're shocked and appalled, but a real rapist and his wife are campaigning for the WH (again) and that's fine with you. Sorry, who is a hypocrite? Look in the mirror.",14,"dogmatic","44"
"45","Mr. Trump charged $1.5 million per speech on his real estate tactics in the past.  Are you interested in what was worth so much?  Or in his role as 'educator' in the Trump University fraud (not accredited, no legitimate degrees granted, just money raked in)?",14,"dogmatic","45"
"46","Just more proof that the fix is in and that there are several tiers of justice in the USA. A young black kid shoplifting a dollar candy bar gets more jail time than a white guy in a suit and a Yale MBA who steals millions and gets a house in East Hampton.",14,"dogmatic","46"
"47","Go Ellen!!  The misogynist wing of the Republican right our out in force this morning. I guess worrying about an female ghostbusters ""trumps"" worrying about the idiosy of a candidate for President that wants gun free zones everywhere, denies climate change and wants to deport 11 million people, build a wall and give ""nukes"" to everyone. Yeah women in a Ghostbusters movie that's what's really important.",14,"dogmatic","47"
"48","so Brewer Lane says she was misrepresented here? but, note that she has not claimed she was misquoted! she's Trump's ex, and a supporter of his campaign, and no one near her warned her about the NYT being ""liberal""? she doesn't sound bright.but, that's the sexism of Trump: surround himself with ignorant but beautiful models (all desperate for fame and money), rather than normal intelligent women.",14,"dogmatic","48"
"49","Oh, the ironies you'll see! The Trumpster-in-the-dumpster without the almighty dollars to perform?! Plus, the most populist campaigns from candidates (one reasonably civilized, one not) maybe ever, may result in an uninspired, lackluster, middle-of-the-road capitalist sneaking in the side door to the West Wing. Wowser!",14,"dogmatic","49"
"50","Well this is good I suppose the the faltering NYT has so little to do, so maybe do a full expose' about Shrillary and her enabling of her pervert, the Bubba........Really does anyone take this crap personally?..... People have lives, all kinds of people in all kinds of circumstance....grow-up....",14,"dogmatic","50"
"51","Came here to read about the  lies, that was exposed this morning. no credibility, no real journalist but it is a very entertaining piece. You should be change your name to New York Entertainment Times because this is not real news Lol",14,"dogmatic","51"
"52","I'm shocked that Donald Trump likes hot chicks. Amazing.Maybe next you could look at Bill Clinton's treatment of women, and how Hillary has stood by him through that?",14,"dogmatic","52"
"53","But the movie looks awful. That's why it is being trashed. For example, look at the joke Leslie Jones makes when she is not caught after jumping off stage. Would that have fit in the orginal Ghostbusters. No it is a clear attempt to use gender or race issues to create humor. This is not funny or Ghostbusters",14,"dogmatic","53"
"54","WRONG!  Times advertisers are salivating over how popular this article is!  How many comments it's getting!   All those pro-DT posters, you're making bucks for the NYTimes!I love it!",14,"dogmatic","54"
"55","Just more proof that he does whatever he thinks is in his own best interest  Gee, hiring smart capable women to top positions who he know will work hard thanks to institutional sexism, what an awful, horrible move for him.  Especially if it helps his business stay afloat so that he can sign the paychecks (little details that government workers don't have to worry about as much, true).   19 trillion dollars, and counting! Wheee!!!!",14,"dogmatic","55"
"56","Ever comment he's made on you?  You mean like, ""I love Mexicans.""?  He has not said one derogatory thing about Mexican people.  I challenge you to prove me wrong.  You're confusing his comments about illegal aliens.",14,"dogmatic","56"
"57","This column belongs in the Museum of Useless Knowledge or The Journal of Negative Results. At most, it says there is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that eating breakfast brings  beneficial efforts.  A long walk for a small beer.",14,"dogmatic","57"
"58","So glad that some of them see that he is totally unsuitable for any elected office much less the Presidency.   He is an arrogant, crude, low information, man boy bully who thinks the Nuclear Triad is a difficult series of holes on one of his golf courses.  If he debates Hillary, she will mop the floor with him and all he will do is call her names.",14,"dogmatic","58"
"59","Biased studies?? Say it ain't so ! I have concluded that most, if not  all, studies are biased, reporting only what the authors/sponsors want the audience to believe.  Eat when you're hungry ? What a novel idea. Thank you Professor Obvious. ",14,"dogmatic","59"
"60","More nonsense science from the Times, reading medical studies and diet articles here will only confuse or even make readers crazy. Editors at the Times have never encountered a study they did not want to publish.",14,"dogmatic","60"
"61","Of course anyone who has more money than me -- without a doubt in my mind -- obtained it illegally!!! Otherwise, how could they get it, and not me???My goodness. Is everyone else as stupid as what they write on the NYUT Comments blog?",14,"dogmatic","61"
"62","Clinton was dumb enough to fall for Turmp's gun-baiting rhetoric.She prob just cost herself a million votes in the general election blabbering about gun control.  She's making it really easy for conservative Dem's to skip voting this time around.  Let the rabid liberal entitled feminists battle it out at the voting booth with Turmp's poorly educated gun loving red meat proxy.",14,"dogmatic","62"
"63","The only one deciding is the individual voter, and overwhelmingly for Trump.  What is the GOP front office needed for?  To prop up the Welfare State like the DNC does?  Donald's not been bought and sold in the political fever swamps like the Clinton Dynasty for 25 years now.  ",14,"dogmatic","63"
"64","Men & their rule have ruined this planet. It is time for women to give it a try. I'm pretty sure money & politics will ruin their efforts too, but I am all or it.As for the new Ghostbuster's -  doesn't really mater whether it was a man or a woman who thought of the idea - it is nothing more than another money grubbing unnecessary reboot. I'm not watching it because there is no reason to.",14,"dogmatic","64"
"65","I'm shocked. I had no idea men weren't suppose to see a woman as attractive and worthy of saying so. I'm a Canadian, and if this is the way men are now suppose to approach women something is seriously wrong with this world.Donald Trump in my book is all man.  Good  for him. ",14,"dogmatic","65"

"68","Jail time - long term jail time - is the only solution for the thieves and crooks and embezzlers who run the banks and Wall Street companies. And jail time for the leaders - like DImon and Cohen and Blankfein - who claim ignorance. They set the tone. If they are truly ignorant of what goes on in their companies then they should be fired - no parachute - as incompetent.",14,"dogmatic","68"
"69","CLOSE LOOPHOLES That enable insider traders and their reckless flaunting of fiscal responsibility.  The gamblers with the nation's financial markets perpetrate economic terrorism, enabled by the banksters who make powerful partners in crime.

"72","Of course some will not donate money. Their donations are intended to buy influence for their crony capitalism ambitions. That is how they became wealthy in the first place. So why give money to someone who they think can not be bought. Hillary can be bought so her political ideology is irrelevant. Give Hillary the money. She is a proven crook.",14,"dogmatic","72"
"73","So sad to read the comments from the drumph supporters. They actually believe  in this obviously  mentally ill man. He's all smoke and mirrors. The fact that he has got this far shows the ignorance of the electorate. I'm not a fan of Hilary but this  guy is clearly nuts.",14,"dogmatic","73"
"74","Trump is clearly a sexist womanizer who looks at women as objects first, people second. And while that's not exactly new news, it's good to see it chronicled and looked into a bit more in depth.Now let's dig into his business dealings and tax returns!",14,"dogmatic","74"

"78","I see you're in the delusional group...not about winning, about doing just fine.  The GOP power elite who are getting on the Trump Train are doing so because they think it will behoove manipulating and controlling him.  Same things that the politicians thought about Stalin and Hitler.",14,"dogmatic","78"
"79","How amazing.  A New York Times that gave Bill Clinton a pass, ignoring his gross conduct with females and his wife as she covered, lied, and destroyed accusers' reputations, has now taken a keen interest in Donald Trump's sexual predation.  The double-standard is breathtaking.  Whited walls.  I won't vote for Trump, but this type of hypocrisy and bias is why people don't trust the Times.",14,"dogmatic","79"
"80","Ha ha ha. Nutrition and food sciences are anything but. Reasonable people should skip and get on with eating and enjoying everything in moderation, as the concept may apply to them.

"81","Sheldon Aldeson's investment just took a hit. Really? That the racist, neo-Mussolini, Trump is also sexist? I am shockedshockedto find that sexism is going on in here!  Apparently there is too much inertia for the GOP to avoid crashing onto the shoals---wonderful. ",14,"dogmatic","81"
"82","I read the article and I watched the CNN and Fox News Reporting of this article.  Two women you interviewed NYT claim this was a hit piece.  Trump is not the story of this article.

"84","Who cares?  Donald Trump never had any traction with the elites anyway.  He doesn't really represent their interests and they are scared although they don't want to admit it.Donald Trump has taken positions that benefit the large majority of citizens and voters.

You must be so proud of yourselves to publish this garbage.",14,"dogmatic","86"
